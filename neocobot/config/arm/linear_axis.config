# define linear axis parameters     #
#####################################
# each linear axis contains the following list of parameters

# 1. component type
# format:   [LINEAR_AXIS_i]
# note:     i is a counter corresponding to the component
# e.g.:     [LINEAR_AXIS_1]

# 2. component name
# name of the current component
# format:   name = ...
# e.g.:     name = axis1

# 3. actuator axis id
# Technosoft board axis id. The axis id is predefined on each board and has to be a unique integer.
# format:   axis_id = ...
# e.g.:     axis_id = 11

# 4. angle limit
# set upper and lower angle limit for actuator in [degrees].
# format:   lower_angle_limit = ...
#           upper_angle_limit = ...
# e.g.:     lower_angle_limit = 0.0
#           upper_angle_limit = 7000.0

# 5. mounting direction (actuators only)
# define in which direction the actuator is mounted.
# 1 means counter clockwise, -1 means clockwise.
# format:   mounting_direction = ...
# e.g.:     mounting_direction = -1

# 6. mechanical stop (actuators only)
# define in which direction the mechanical stop is located for calibrating.
# 1 means counter clockwise, -1 means clockwise.
# format:   mechanical_stop = ...
# e.g.:     mechanical_stop = 1

# 7. current factor (actuators only)
# set the factor with which the current limit of the actuator is reduced during calibration.
# format:   current_factor = ...
# e.g.:     current_factor = 0.5

# full example:
# 1.    [LINEAR_AXIS_1]
# 2.    name                = axis1
# 3.    axis_id             = 11
# 4.    lower_angle_limit   = 0.0
#       upper_angle_limit   = 7000.0
# 5.    mounting_direction  = -1
# 6.    mechanical_stop     = 1
# 7.    current_factor      = 0.5
