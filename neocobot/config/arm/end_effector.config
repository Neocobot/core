#####################################
# define end effector parameters    #
#####################################
# each end effector contains the following list of parameters

# 1. component type
# format:   [END_EFFECTOR_i]
# note:     i is a counter corresponding to the component, i=1 refers to the default end effector
# e.g.:     [END_EFFECTOR_1]

# 2. component name
# name of the current component
# format:   name = ...
# e.g.:     name = PGrip1

# 3. actuator axis id (only if end effector has an actuator)
# Technosoft board axis id. The axis id is predefined on each board and has to be a unique integer.
# format:   axis_id = ...
# e.g.:     axis_id = 7

# 4. angle limit (only if end effector has an actuator)
# set upper and lower angle limit for actuator in [degrees].
# format:   lower_angle_limit = ...
#           upper_angle_limit = ...
# e.g.:     lower_angle_limit = -175.0
#           upper_angle_limit = 175.0

# 5. mounting direction (only if end effector has an actuator)
# define in which direction the actuator is mounted.
# 1 means counter clockwise, -1 means clockwise.
# format:   mounting_direction = ...
# e.g.:     mounting_direction = -1

# 6. mechanical stop (only if end effector has an actuator)
# define in which direction the mechanical stop is located for calibrating.
# 1 means counter clockwise, -1 means clockwise.
# format:   mechanical_stop = ...
# e.g.:     mechanical_stop = -1

# 7. current factor (only if end effector has an actuator)
# set the factor with which the current limit of the actuator is reduced during calibration.
# format:   current_factor = ...
# e.g.:     current_factor = 0.5

# 8. tool center point pose
# set the pose (positions in [mm], angles in [degrees]) of the end effector expressed in the robot frame.
# format:   pose_x     = ...
#           pose_y     = ...
#           pose_z     = ...
#           pose_roll  = ...
#           pose_pitch = ...
#           pose_yaw   = ...
# e.g.:     pose_x     = 0
#           pose_y     = 0
#           pose_z     = 285.9
#           pose_roll  = 0
#           pose_pitch = 90
#           pose_yaw   = -90

# 9. mass
# total mass of the end effector (including motors, cover and the moving part on top of P-Rob) in [kg]
# format:   mass = ...
# e.g.:     mass = 1.321

# 10. coordinates of the center of mass (CoM)
# set the position of the CoM of the end effector, expressed in the robot frame
# format:   CoM_x = ...
#           CoM_y = ...
#           CoM_z = ...
# e.g.:     CoM_x = 0
#           CoM_y = 0
#           CoM_z = 100

# full example for end effector with actuator:
# 1.    [END_EFFECTOR_1]
